How it operates
---------------
Alexander, the owner of a Menkoi Salon, intends to change the hours of operation.

Alexander is given two options:

1. In the absence of "localbusiness.txt," he would have to manually update the scheduling information on multiple sites such as Yelp, Foursquare, and Zaubee. Despite these attempts, endless websites will almost certainly continue to advertise incorrect working hours.

2. Alexander, the owner of a growing company, benefits from the effective use of the "localbusiness.txt" structure by efficiently managing and changing the operating schedule. Alexander may simply edit the schedule on his dedicated website, triggering a chain reaction of automated adjustments across a wide range of systems that quickly embrace the adoption of this standardized file.

Challenges with existing solutions
----------------------------------
There isn't a simple, cheap, and worldwide solution to get the latest information of local businesses. There should be one! Website providers need it. Local businesses need it.
Local businesses now have three options for updating the most recent information:

1. Some local businesses update their information on all of their websites. It takes too long, and there are thousands of websites with the same material. Many of them do not enable you to change the data.
2. Other local businesses pay for a service like [https://zaubee.com](https://zaubee.com), which can cost more than $500 each year. They update the content on major websites, but their information is also available on hundreds of other websites.
3. Other local businesses may want to consider adding metadata to their websites (through http://schema.org/). The problem is that it is too difficult for non-developers to grasp.
Websites, on the other hand, must now urge their users or local businesses to update their information. It takes far too long. And out-of-date information might impair a user's experience with a website or app.

There isn't a straightforward, low-cost, global method for getting the most up-to-date information about local firms. There should be! It is required of website providers. It is necessary for local enterprises.
